    <p class="quote-sport-description">
      The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week for
      adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that number to 110
      minutes every day? While it might seem like a high number to hit,
      dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer unparalleled
      benefits to physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of
      life.
